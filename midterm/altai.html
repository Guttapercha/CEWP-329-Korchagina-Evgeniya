      <h3 class="gap0">Mountains and glaciers</h3>
		<p>All the territory of the Republic is located within the mountainous system. The mountains’ altitude varies from 350 to 4500 meters. The real beauty of the region is the Mount Belukha, the highest peak of Siberia (4506 m). It is actually 1000 m higher than the surrounding mountain ridges. There are 3 big ridges which are 3000 – 4000 m high. Their peaks are covered with snow and ice all year long.</p><p> At present there are 1499 glaciers with a total area of 910 square km which consists of 39 cubic km of frozen water. The largest glaciers stretch for several kilometers. The Altai Mountains are relatively young. So periodic seismic activity is notable here.</p> 
   
      <h3>Rivers and lakes</h3>
		<p>Altai Mountains form the world watershed between the internal Central Asian watershed and the Arctic Ocean watershed. The whole region is rich in water resources. More than 20,000 tributaries sprawl throughout the mountainous Republic, making for a total of more than 60,000 kilometers worth of waterways. The republic's largest rivers are the Katun and the Biya, both of which originate in the mountains and flow northwards. The junction of the two rivers eventually forms the Ob River, one of the longest rivers in Siberia, which flows northward to the Arctic Ocean.</p>
		<p>The largest rivers are the Katun and the Biya. The Ob River, one of the greatest and longest rivers in Siberia, is formed by the confluence of the Katun and Biya.</p>
		<p>One of the most beautiful lakes is Teletskoye Lake. It is the largest in the Altai Republic, 80 km long and 5 km wide with a maximum depth of 325 meters. The mountain lakes of the territory keep enormous reserves of the purest fresh water.</p> 
		
		<h3>Flora</h3>
		<p>Four fairly distinct vegetation zones can be discerned in the Altai: mountain subdesert, mountain steppe, mountain forest, and the alpine regions. The first, found on lower slopes and in hollows of the Mongolian and Gobi Altai, reflects the high summer temperatures and low rainfall: the sparse life includes xerophytic (drought-tolerant) and halophytic (salt-tolerant) plants. The mountain steppe zone rises to about 600 metres in the north and to 2,000 metres in the south and east. Meadows and mixed-grass steppes are characterized by sod grasses, forb species, and steppe shrubs.</p>

		<p> The mountain forest zone is most characteristic of the Altai proper; it covers about seven-tenths of the territory, mostly in the low and medium mountain regions. Forests reach up to elevations of 2,000 metresbut climb to about 2,400 metres on the drier slopes of the central and eastern Altai. Most prevalent are coniferous species—larches, firs, and pines (including the Siberian stone pine)—but there are also large areas covered by secondary birch and aspen forests. A forest belt is practically nonexistent in the Mongolian and Gobi Altai, but isolated clumps of coniferous trees grow in river valleys. Alpine vegetation—subalpine shrubs giving way to meadows widely used for summer pasture and then to mosses and bare rock and ice—is found only on the highest ridges.</p>	
	
		<h3>Fauna</h3>
		<p>Animal life follows vegetation patterns. Various rodents populate the mountainous semideserts and steppes, while birdlife includes eagles, hawks, and kestrels. Most species are of Mongolian origin—e.g., marmot, jerboa (a jumping rodent), and antelope. Siberian mammals (bears, lynx, musk deer, and squirrels) and birds (hazel grouse and woodpeckers) frequent the moist coniferous forests. Alpine animal life includes the mountain goat, snow leopard, and mountain ram.</p>
